# fish morphology code
basic code and automated workflows to produce analysis friendly data from annotated fish images


## Bare minimum contents contains:

- [ ] manifest of the locations of original image data + segmentations
- [ ] script for taking original images and generating 2D normalized images
- [x] structure annotations for each segmented cell
- [ ] text-ish version of cellprofiler workflow to generate single cell segmentations and features from image data + segmentations


## Stretch goals

- [ ] original image data + annotations into fms/labkey/quilt, or somehow programatically downloadable
