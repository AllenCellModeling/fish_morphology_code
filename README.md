# fish morphology code
basic code and automated workflows to produce analysis friendly data from annotated fish images


## Bare minimum contents contains:

- [ ] manifest of the locations of original image data + segmentations
- [ ] structure annotations for each segmented cell
- [ ] text-ish version of cellprofilers workflow to generate features from image data + segmentations
- [ ] script for generating single cell images for each channel


## Stretch goals

- [ ] original image data + annotations into fms/labkey/quilt, or somehow programatically downloadable
