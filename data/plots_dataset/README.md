# Dataset for producing plots in the manuscript

This dataset is the result of merging many of the other computed metrics data sets, and renaming columns to be more human readable / appropriate for direct plot generation.
All data-driven plots in the manuscript from the main FISH / alpha-actinin-2 dataset get made from this data.
