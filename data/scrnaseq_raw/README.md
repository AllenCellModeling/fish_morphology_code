# AICS cardio scRNA-seq data 

**Overview:** This dataset contains single cell RNA-sequencing data from in vitro hiPSC derived cardiomyocytes
and includes both raw (fastq) and processed data (count matrix).

## Cardiomyocyte differentiation and sample collection 
hiPSCs were differentiated into cardiomyocytes using two protocols: small molecule (Lian et al. 2012) and 
cytokine (Palpant et al. 2015). Samples were collected for sequencing at 4 time points: 1) D0 time point
before the initiation of differentiation, 2) D12/D14 after differentiation was initiated, 3) D24/D26, and 4) D90.

## Library preparation and sequencing
Single cell libraries were prepared using the Split-Seq method. (see manuscript for more details)

## Contents 
- `fastq`: raw fastq files
- `read_assignment`: read assignment to gene
